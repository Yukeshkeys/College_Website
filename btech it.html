        <img src="download (2).jpg" id="log">
        <p> Computer science and information technology (IT) are two distinct subjects, despite their many similarities. Generally, computer science refers to designing and building computers and computer programs. Information technology, on the other hand, refers to maintaining and troubleshooting those computers and their networks, systems, and databases to ensure they run smoothly.
            So while working in a computer science-based job might mean you’ll create software, design websites, or gather information on visitors to a website, a career in IT can mean you’ll make sure computers are functional and secure
            The line between IT and computer science is often blurry. Sometimes working in IT will require knowledge of computer science principles, and being a programmer will mean carrying out tasks that are considered more IT-related. And sometimes jobs that are computer-science heavy, like web development or software engineering, are referred to as IT work. All of this can lead to very understandable confusion.</p>

        <h2><i>Scope of the Course:</i></h2>
        <p>Computer science engineers (CSE) are involved in many computing perspectives, from the design of microprocessors, PCs, supercomputers to circuit designing and writing programs that power them. Information Technology (IT) involves using computers and software to save, preserve the process, transmit, and securely recover data.</p>
