        <h2><i>About Course:</i></h2>
        <img src="download (6).jpg" id="log">
        <p>The five-year program at School of Architecture VIT adopts a flexible system wherein the student has opportunities to choose among a wide variety of courses both at school as well as the University level. The courses are designed in such a way that there is a blended learning system through which students get a practical experience of the theoretical classroom learning. Through these courses students develop an aptitude for optimizing space dynamics, architectural representation, research, writing, software, technical and managerial aspects. Design Studios which carry a higher credit value demand a holistic application of the knowledge and skills towards problem definition and resolution. The program requires students to carry out a mandatory internship at an Architect’s office for a period of 6 months. Architectural Travel Learning is an important aspect of the B. Arch Curriculum at VIT, wherein students will be taken to various national and international destinations to explore and experience the rich architecture and culture of the places. The final year of study focuses primarily on a complex problem-solving task called ‘Architectural Thesis’ in which students are expected to apply certain knowledge areas that they consider their strengths and present them in the form of drawings, models and other digital modes. Students are also encouraged to publish their dissertation and thesis projects as articles in reputed journals.
            There are opportunities for the students to take up collaborative projects with other reputed international Universities through International Transfer Program, Semester Abroad Program and Joint Studio Programs. Through our Value Added Programs (VAPs) such as the ‘Art Festival’ and ‘Heritage Connect’, students find a pathway to connect to the community beyond the boundaries of VIT.</p>
